# Communities Impacted By Urban Flooding 

Urban flooding is a major issue in many coastal cities including New York. Extreme rainfall leaves many communities vulnerable to harm caused by flooding, such as property damage, sewer back ups, basement seepage, health concerns and more. One instance of urban flooding causing extensive damage was when so much flood water built up on a private worksite, it broke through the plywood barrier separating it from the Court Street train station. Soon the platform was filled with storm water. This is only one instance of the devastating impacts of urban flooding, these types of incidents happen in coastal cities whenever it rains, and with global warming, these incidents will become more frequent and deadly. 

## Urban Flooding in the Gowanus

### Introduction to the Gowanus Canal

Located in Brooklyn, New York, the Gowanus Canal is a man made canal constructed in the late 1960s. It is known for being one of the most polluted bodies of water in one of the wealthiest cities in the world. Its murky oily waters filled with black tar at the bottom are monetized by local businesses by giving their menu items polluted canal themed names and hosting events where the canal is characterized as the mythical River of Styx. The extreme pollution at the Gowanus Canal is a result of how it was used in the past. It was a prime spot for coal manufacturing, chemical plants, cement making, and many other environmentally detrimental activities. These actions are what made the Gowanus Canal the filthy dystopian wreck it is today. However, the pungent odor caused by the canal is not the only issue residents of the Gowanus neighborhood have to face. Urban flooding, frequently caused by rainstorms, is another major burden added to the residents of the neighborhood.

### Health Risks caused by Flooding in the Gowanus 

Urban flooding in all locations is dangerous, but the rapid rate of destruction happening to Earth combined with the filthy state of the notorious Gowanus Canal, creates a recipe for disaster in the Gowanus neighborhood. Flooding in the Gowanus causes the spread of human waste and many other toxins from the canal. When flooding occurs, residents of the Gowanus have to commute and drive through high levels of toxic water on the road, and basements fill up with bacteria infested waters. After inspecting the toxic flooding, it was found that a bacteria called enterococcus can be found. Enterococci is usually found in our intestines, but when exposed to from the outside, it can cause inflammation and infections. Water samples taken from the Gowanus canal have shown that if an individual is repeatedly exposed to gowanus canal water there is a potential cancer risk. With flooding becoming more frequent, these risks have become even more dangerous and more likely to harm people.  

### Expenses and Solutions for Flooding in the Gowanus 

Urban flooding is an expensive issue due to how much it costs to repair damage and prevent any future damage. Sewage back ups or basement flooding are few of the expensive ways flooding causes damage. In order to prevent or minimize the damage caused by urban flooding, people have teamed up to take action. Earlier last year, a 27 million dollar sewer expansion plan to reduce flooding in the lower streets of the Gowanus was completed. This plan was part of another 53 million dollar plan, created by the DEP to tackle urban flooding. They built catch basins, rain gardens, and storm sewers that have been effectively reducing flooding during rainstorms. The rain gardens are very helpful, as 70 rain gardens were built and they can gather over 6 million gallons of storm water each year. This project also included installing 87 catch basins that will dispose of storm water from the streets and away from the sewage system. Another solution that was implemented through this plan was to build 90 bioswales, which allow plants to take up excess stormwater. These are all necessary measures to tackle the dangerous issue of urban flooding, especially when it causes the spread of the extremely toxic Gowanus water.

## Urban Flooding in Coney Island 

### Introduction to Coney Island

Coney Island is a well known neighborhood in Brooklyn that turns into a go-to summer relaxation spot in the summer for Brooklyn residents. Tourists visit the nearby amusement park, Luna Park and Coney Island beach, and other popular tourist spots. Despite the neighborhoods many positive attributes, it is one of New York's flood prone locations, making it vulerable to all sorts of infrastructure damage and more.

### Flooding Risk and Expenses in Coney Island

Coney Island is a high flood risk location, and it's risk continues to increase. 99 percent of the properties in Coney Island are in risk of being damged by flooding. Currently 1,590 properties are at risk, but in fifteen years, this number is expected to increase by 7.4 percent, putting 1,707 properties at risk, and in 30 years, there is a 14.7 percent expected increase in properties at risk. Of the 1,590 properties at flood risk right now, they all have a chance of water entering their buildings and causing up to four feet of flooding. These high levels of flood risk are very expensive as well. This year, the flood damage costs $27K, but in 30 years, there  is an expected 188 percent increase, costing $789.7K in damage.

## Urban Flooding and Hurricane Sandy

### Introduction  

Hurricane Sandy was one of the deadliest hurricanes to ever approach the United States, and it is a historic event in October 2012, known for being the most destructive event of the year. It went through many areas, including coastal locations of New York and New Jersey. The damage was so destructive that it killed nearly 72 Americans, destroyed 650,000 homes and needed 70.2 billion dollars to repair all the damage. Storms that occur on a day to day basis tend to have devastating impacts on coastal cities by causing street flooding, sewage back ups, basement seepage, and more. Hurricane Sandy multiplied the "normal" flooding damage in coastal cities by a large number, leaving cities like New York with a huge mess to clean up after.

### Hurricane Sandy's Impact on Urban Flooding and New Yorkers

New York was one of the locations that was heavily influenced by SuperStorm Sandy. When the hurricane arrived, it flooded 17 percent of the city, leaving 44 civilians dead. As always, urban flooding causes immense property damage and harms civilians. Due to the massive flooding caused by the hurricane, the aftermath was more devastating than a regular rainstorm. 88,700 buildings were flooded, 23,400 businesses were victims to the flood, and more than two million residents were left with faulty power and fuel for weeks after the storm passed through. New York City alone suffered from a 19 billion dollar loss as a result of damage repair and economic inactivity caused by the flooding. The superstorm caused bodies of water near the city, such as the Hudson River, East River or New York Harbor, to send large waves of water onto the land, often reaching as far as 2 blocks from the coastline. The floods reaching inland could be as deep as three feet, making commute and repair extremely difficult, and contributing to the high economic loss resulting from the hurricane.

### Minimizing Flood-Related Threats During Storms 

While we can't prevent hurricanes entirely and they will only become more frequent and deadly due to global warming, it is worth noting what coastal cities can do to minimize the damage civilians and infrastructure have to face after a deadly storm like Hurricane Sandy. Well-developed flood evacuation plans are a critical practice that should be implemented just as often fire drills are. This could prevent many casualties caused by superstorms and ensure everyone's safety. Similar to what is being done to manage flooding in the Gowanus, setting up more bioswales, rain gardens, catch basins, or storm sewers can lend a small helping hand in tackling the damage caused by superstorms like Sandy. It also helps to do a better job at tracking flood-prone locations so we can identify which areas will most likely need backup and assistance far before the storm hits. Many of these approaches can also be applied to manage urban flooding caused by a casual rain storm, but the extra steps can make a large difference when facing a threat similar to the one in 2012.   


# Current Flood Mitigation

## The Construction Code
The Construction Code sets standards for safe flood-resistant construction. It determined the DFE (designated flood elevation), which is the minimal elevation from the ground to be protected from flooding. If a building has occupants in it, the lowest floor with residents must always be above the DFE. Levels below the DFE can only be used for parking, storage, or similar purposes. 

## Protecting Buildings
Urban flooding can cause a lot of damage to properties including buildings. Part of the current flood mitigation is to protect buildings by using flood-protective materials and other methods. 
- Dry floodproofing is a method that involves using water-tight construction methods that provide temporary barriers to keep floodwater out.  
- Wet floodproofing involves using flood-resistant materials that allow floodwater in and out by causing little to no damage.
- Elevating buildings above the DFE
- Land and street elevation
- Elevating mechanical equipment above the DFE

## Green Infrastructure
Green infrastructure is a method used to solve issues with the help of nature. With the help of green infrastructure, the effects of urban flooding can be significantly minimized. Below are a few examples of green infrastructure being implemented to minimize urban flooding.
- Green roofs: Help cool buildings and reduce the amount of stormwater going into sewers by capturing rain in barrels. 
- Rain gardens: A depression on a landscape containing different plants. They help minimize flooding by collecting rainwater and soaking it underground before it can flood the streets. 
- Bioswales: Bioswales also contain plants that soak up rainwater before it floods the streets. However, a major difference between bioswales and rain gardens, is that bioswales also remove pollutants. 
- Rain gardens: A depression on a landscape containing different plants. They help minimize flooding by collecting rainwater and soaking it underground before it can flood the streets.

## Stormwater Resiliency Plan and Goals
With climate change becoming a rapidly deteriorating issue, urban flooding has already started to increase. From 1958 to 2012, there has been a 70 percent increase in rainfall, which can be linked to increased flooding. These factors required actions to prepare for the future, so in 2017 the Storm Water Resiliency Plan was developed. This plan assigned roles and set a series of goals to properly prepare and face the issue of flooding in New York City. The table below represents the key goals of the plan:
| Goal                                                       | Initiatives                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
